        This is my first website that I have

        coding inside it!

        If you think that you can't get a job as a
        IT specialist because your not young to do this,
        or you can't because you need to get a masters
        degree, its too late to start learning or that
        you need to be a genius at maths, that means
        that you have heard too many myths about
        starting a career in IT. Only about 28% of
        programmers/data scientists / data analysists
        developers, quantum computing devs and much more,
        have a master degree! You don't need to be
        a genius, you don't need to have a masters
        degree (not even bachlers degree) and you don't
        need to be young to start a new way of working.
        About 12% of really good programmers have from
        30-58 years! Let's look at how much money
        (in a year) can you make at a different age.

      As you can see on this graph, the older you are,
      more money you can make. But that's not what we are
      looking for. We are looking at the salary and why
      do so many people make that kind of money with just
      python language. I will remind you of something else.
      Only about 28% of programmers, data scientists, etc.
      have got a masters degree, so theres nothing to worry
      about (that number is still going down). On the polish
      course called Coders Lab, there was about 7 or 8
      people that have got a master degree and nobody else,
      and yet everybody was on the same level. It doesn't matter
      what age you are, gender, hobbies or other. You can become
      a developer, data scientist, data analisist etc. without any
      degree. You can just finish a course on sololearn or
      Coders Lab so that you can have a good paying job and
      less time taking.
